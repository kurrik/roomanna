Oh boy, Suspiria.  A prime example of the "cheesy horror movies so
well crafted that they can be considered art films" genre.  I can't even
remember what first added it to my queue, but I do remember seeing references
to it in a crazy 2010
[playthough of the SNES game Clock Tower](http://www.rpgcodex.net/forums/index.php?threads/lets-survive-the-clock-tower-100-complete.41519/)
which led me to the following reasoning:

1. Clock Tower is an insanely weird, horrific, and beautiful game.
2. Clock Tower [cribs scenes directly from Suspiria]({{ link "clock-tower-suspiria.png" }}).
3. Therefore, Suspiria must be even more weird, horrific, and beautiful than Clock Tower.

I finally sat around to watch Suspiria as part of
[Cinema Club](/tags/cinemaclub). It starts off earnestly, showing the
protagonist's arrival at a creepy German ballet school in the middle of a
thunderstorm.  A visibly distressed girl runs out the
door of the school and into the rainy night. This girl makes it to a friend's
apartment only to be violently murdered by some kind of ghost.

Suspiria has several make-your-skin-crawl scenes.
We are shown a knife stabbing directly into a person's beating heart.  A
girl falls into a room filled wall-to-wall with barbed wire and can't stand
up to reach the nearby door.  A girl is pushed through a skylight and the
falling debris impales her friend.  Yet for each of these scenes,
the rest of the movie
is riddled with plot, acting, and technical flaws.
Audio is especially bad.  The cast spoke a mixture of English,
Italian, and German so everything is dubbed via ADR
and none of the dialogue quite matches up with the actors' mouths.

I don't want to tear Suspiria apart&mdash;I love a movie which wears
its heart so proudly on its sleeve, and I did enjoy watching it, especially
the absolutely stunning cinematography. Suspiria is a
[Technicolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor) movie through and
through.  It's got that hyper-real contrast-too-high quality, and
every single color pops.  In fact, it was apparently printed on the last
Technicolor printer in Rome, two years after the last US plant was closed down.

The production method appears to have abandoned for being
slow and expensive, rather than producing inferior quality.
Granted, modern films do [all sorts of grading](https://twitter.com/ThingsWork/status/653791549331935232)
digitally, but to get the kinds of shots in
Suspiria out of a slow analog process impresses me.
Coming out so late in Technicolor's history, I like to think of Suspiria
as some kind of apex, the culmination of decades of work on analog color in cinema.

Several major scenes in the film take place at night, in darkness.  Suspiria
gives each scene a unique dramatic atmosphere by flooding the frame with
filtered red, green, or blue light.  It's understood that the characters
are in pitch darkness, but we see everything going on in an eerie otherworldly
way.

The tones in each scene are so dramatic that I've put palettes beneath the
screenshots above to show how monochromatic these scenes are.  They run
exclusively black/red, black/green, and black/blue, which, maybe not coincidentally,
are the colors used in the three-strip Technicolor process.
I have to wonder if these scenes were maybe only shot with a single strip,
in order to save money on film and processing costs (in addition to giving
the striking look).

Which isn't to say that lit scenes in Suspiria are any less striking.  The
sets and framing in the movie are meticulously designed.  Look at the way
the lighting breaks the symmetry of the staircase in the back of this hallway
scene, or how the tan tones equally balance out the strong red highlights
(with a perfect hit of turquoise up at the top).

<div class="centered">
  <img class="analyze"

    src="{{link "suspiria-hallway-01-lg.jpg" }}"
    alt="Red / tan hallway scene from Suspiria" />
  <div class="Palettes"></div>
</div>

Red plays a very prominent role in the film and there's no lack of it in
most scenes.  But it is also very balanced with black and tan tones.
The intricate patterns on the walls of the school always stand out.
Texture and depth everywhere.

    alt="Red / black hallway scene from Suspiria" />
  <div class="Palettes"></div>
</div>


I love the attention to detail in the framing, light, and texturing of
this scene.  It looks like a Baroque painting (albeit with a clunky 70s phone).

    src="{{link "suspiria-gold-lg.jpg" }}"
    alt="Black and gold scene from Suspiria" />
  <div class="Palettes"></div>
</div>

And here's a wonderfully balanced Blue / Orange scene.
Opposite sides of the color wheel are used as complimentary colors
and the number of tones on each side are roughly even.

    width="1400" height="600"

</div>

There's a blind character in Suspiria who walks with a guide dog and a cane.
I noticed his cane was white in earlier scenes which seemed unusual, but I
figured it was just a cool Italian fashion.

Later on, there's an important scene featuring this character, set in a
dark plaza.  The choice of white cane seems intended for this scene,
as it highlights his handicap, along with the white service band his dog
wears.  The red cross on the band stands out like a splash of blood, the
only non-blue tone in an otherwise muted scene.

So I liked Suspiria, it was fun to look at for a few hours.  It was also
fun to analyze, once I started noticing all the work put into the colors of
the film.

A while ago I took a class where we used
[k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to
identify color palettes for compressing image data.  I wanted to do the
same for the Suspiria screenshots, so I wrote up a quick and dirty
JavaScript implementation.  It generated the color palettes below each
image in this post.

K-means is an approach to classifying data. You pick a value of k
(in this case it's <span data-display="k"></span>) and choose that many
"centroids" at random out of your data points.  For each remaining data point,
you pick the centroid closest to the point and assign it to that centroid's
cluster.  When all the points have been assigned, you move the centroids to
the average of every point in their cluster, and then clear the clusters and
repeat the process until the centroids stop moving.

In this case, the data points are individual pixel colors, and k is the size
of the palette.  There's a random component in my implementation, and k-means
doesn't always find the best grouping (or sometimes takes very long to converge)
so changing the random number seed results in different output.  It was fun
to see how changing these values affected the palettes, so I left in the
sliders below.  Every time you change the values a new palette is added below
each image, so you can see how the changes affect things from iteration to
iteration. As an example of things which can change, the red cross in the
last image usually gets clustered into its own shade, but sometimes falls into
another non-red cluster and is averaged out.

  <div class="col-sm-6">

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <label>K (<span data-display="k"></span>)</label>
    <input type="range" min="1", max="32" data-binding="k" />
  </div>

Bet you didn't think you'd be learning about data mining techniques in an
article about a 70s horror film!
