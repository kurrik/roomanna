Oh boy, Suspiria.  A prime example of the "cheesy horror movies so
well crafted that they can be considered art films" genre.  I can't even
remember what first added it to my queue, but I do remember reading a
[crazy Let's Play thread for Clock Tower on SNES](http://www.rpgcodex.net/forums/index.php?threads/lets-survive-the-clock-tower-100-complete.41519/)
in 2010 which led to the following reasoning:

1. Clock Tower is an insanely weird, horrific, and beautiful game.
2. Clock Tower [cribs scenes directly from Suspiria]({{ link "clock-tower-suspiria.png" }}).
3. Therefore, Suspiria must be even more weird, horrific, and beautiful than Clock Tower.

I finally sat around to watch Suspiria as part of
[Cinema Club](/tags/cinemaclub). It starts off earnestly, with an American
dancer named Suzy showing up to a German ballet school in the middle of a
rainy night.  Another girl, Pat, runs out the door and into the rainy night,
obviously distressed.  Things don't go that well for Pat.  She's eventually
murdered in an incredibly violent manner and pushed through a stained glass
skylight.

Suspiria has several scenes which make my skin crawl to think about.
We are shown a knife stabbing directly into Pat's beating heart.  Another
girl falls into a room filled wall-to-wall with barbed wire and can't stand
up to reach the nearby door.  But the gaps between have many plot,
acting, and technical flaws.  Audio is especially bad - everything is dubbed
via ADR since the original cast spoke a mixture of English, Italian, and German
and none of the dialogue quite matches up with the mouth movements.

I don't really want to tear Suspiria apart&mdash;I love a movie which wears
its heart so proudly on its sleeve, and I did enjoy watching it, especially
the absolutely stunning cinematography. Suspiria is a
[Technicolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor) movie through and
through.  It's got that hyper-real contrast-too-high quality, and
every single color pops.  In fact, it was apparently printed on the last
Technicolor printer in Rome, two years after the last US plant was closed down.
In my mind, I like to think that this was the pinnacle of the Technicolor
process, the culmination of decades of technical work on color in cinema.
