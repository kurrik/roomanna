Is there a formal name for the idea that someone is mostly the sum of their
external influences?  So much of my day-to-day depends on what movies I've
watched, which books I've read, and what music I've listened to.
And that's not entirely because the Twitter Developer Relations team
is a hodgepodge of cosmopolitan folks and the references fly fast and
furious in our work area, but because everything is so culturally
interconnected nowadays.

An example: a developer in Germany told me
to read Corey Doctorow's [Little Brother][4], which mentioned
[The Death and Life of Great American Cities][5] by Jane Jacobs, which
taught me why Civic Center in SF is such a mess, which helped form my
opinion of Twitter's recent move to the neighborhood,
and also let me get the reference when Andy made an
offhand comment about her in Season 7 of Weeds:

I've also been really inspired by Pamela Fox's [reading list][1].
Many folks know her as a developer evangelist or engineer, but that
list alone reveals facets of her personality that you wouldn't really
know by just reading the technical posts she puts up.  So I've decided
to start writing down notes about the stuff that I consume from a day to
day basis, so that maybe a bit more of who I am comes through on this
site, and so that I have something to point to instead of just
sounding pretentious when I give my summed up opinion of things
to the big cheese:

A quick note about my philosophy of reviews: scores are nonsense, and
so are generalized thumbs-up/thumbs-down systems.  Authors spend so
much time on their work that if more people started writing a couple
of paragraphs to explain what something made them feel, we might get
away from the "Epic Fail" or "Epic Win" bullshit that pervades so
much today.

The best example I can give of what I'd love to be able to do
is [outlawvern.com][2].  He doesn't review a movie so much as explain
what happens, make a few really insightful jokes, and then say why
you may or may not agree with him, to great effect.  Reviews for
folks who can be comfortable making up their own opinions.  His
theories on [Nick Cage][3] and "mega-acting" changed my life.
