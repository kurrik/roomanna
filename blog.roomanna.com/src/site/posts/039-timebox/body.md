Since starting a new job tends to involve a lot of reflection on the prior one,
I've spent some time recently thinking about my
[time at Twitter]({{link "037-1999-days"}}).  While there were both good and bad
 parts, I generally feel like I had a few great opportunities to participate in
product design and understand how even simple looking products tend to have a
lot of hidden edge cases and adjustments to smooth those over.

I generally use the example of
[analytics.twitter.com](https://analytics.twitter.com).  Superficially, this
site has a very direct purpose--to show you numbers associated with your
Tweets.  But as my team started exploring a landing page which would show
aggregated impressions, we found all sorts of cases which would surprise our
customers.

<!--BREAK-->

{{define "imagedata"}}
monthly_impressions:
  Image: {{imagemeta "monthly-impressions.png" | tojson}}
  Alt: "Monthly impression counts"
tweet_alltime_impressions:
  Image: {{imagemeta "tweet-alltime-impressions.png" | tojson}}
  Alt: "Alltime impression counts for a single Tweet"
tweet_monthly_impressions:
  Image: {{imagemeta "tweet-monthly-impressions.png" | tojson}}
  Alt: "Monthly impression counts for a single Tweet"
{{end}}

{{define "image"}}
  <p class="centered"><img style="width:50%;height:50%" width="{{.Image.Width}}" height="{{.Image.Height}}" src="{{.Image.Path}}" alt="{{.Alt}}" /></p>
{{end}}

For an example of this, it's interesting to consider that for the purposes of
reporting analytics, a given Tweet impression is associated with two
timestamps.  First is when the impression occurred, and second is when the
Tweet which is being viewed was created (always before the impression, as you
would expect).  You can graph these two values, as I have below using simulated
data:

<div class="centered" id="example00"></div>

Say you wanted to aggregate a set of impressions on a certain day. This would
be represented by cutting a vertical slice in the graph and summing up the
count of impressions inside that slice.

<div class="centered" id="example01"></div>

This is roughly equivalent to the monthly aggregation view in
[the Twitter Analytics home page](https://analytics.twitter.com/user/*/home).
It represents the total number of impressions that month, but could include
impressions from Tweets created before the period, and may not include every
impression for a Tweet created within the period.

{{template "image" (yamltemplate "imagedata").monthly_impressions}}

Turns out, this is not strictly what people expect if you say "Tweet
impressions in July". The intuition for many of our users was to select all the
Tweets which were created in July and sum up the impression number for
each.  This was possible due to another feature our team built--all-time
impressions on Tweet activity pages:

{{template "image" (yamltemplate "imagedata").tweet_alltime_impressions}}

For a Tweet created in July, this count might include impressions which
occurred in August or even later.  So summing up this number for all Tweets in
a given time range can be thought of as a horizontal slice in the Tweet
impression graph:

<div class="centered" id="example02"></div>

Given these two methods of aggregation, imagine the method to select a "Top"
Tweet for a given month.  Selecting the maximum by either horizontal or vertical
slice might return a Tweet created in the wrong month (this could easily happen
if a Tweet was create toward the end of a month and got the bulk of its
impressions in the following month).

One approach we considered was to take the best Tweet from the intersection of
both horizontal and vertical slices.  But if you look at the corresponding
square in the chart below, you can see that this method biases for Tweets which
occur toward the start of the period.  A popular Tweet which split its
impressions equally across two months may not be the top in either.

<div class="centered" id="example03"></div>

Eventually, we figured the least surprising approach was to return the Tweet
which got the most impressions in the given month.  This number is displayed
as part of the Top Tweet UI:

{{template "image" (yamltemplate "imagedata").tweet_monthly_impressions}}

Of course, this means that the Top Tweet in July might be a Tweet created in
June, but we figured our users would understand.  When we tested this with
various accounts' data it made sense, but highlighted another edge
case--accounts which tended to Tweet less frequently commonly had the same Top
Tweet for two months.  Originally I didn't think this would be much of an
issue, but seeing it happen with real data changed my mind.  It looked
terrible, especially if multiple pairs of months on the same page shared the
same Top Tweet.

I wound up implementing the Top Tweet endpoint in a way which
returned a pool of candidate Tweets.  The frontend would select the first
Top Tweet which hadn't already been displayed in the page.  It was one of many
cases where we elected to show less correct data in order to give a better
user experience.  Eventually we did the same thing with media Tweets too, in
that your Top Media Tweet would never be a Tweet which was already your
Top Tweet.

Of course, this kind of thing isn't unique to Twitter, or analytics.  One of
my favorite examples is from Slack:
