[blog-2017]: {{link "043-2017"}}
Two years ago I started setting personal OKRs (Objectives and Key Results).  I
[wrote about the 2017 results here][blog-2017] and decided to carry the
practice forward into 2018.  I wanted to recap how things have gone and how I'm
thinking about this experiment going into 2019.

I am aware that this is a bit of a ridiculous exercise.  My answer to "do you
have any New Year's Resolutions in 2018?" was "well it's like 13 metrics-driven
resolutions spread across three main themes".  Most people probably wouldn't
find value in this kind of system, and I think it would be fair to criticize me
for taking this approach to achieve goals like "happiness".  I probably overdid
it this year by trying to do too much.  I felt stressed out about making
progress on these goals and that led me to be very protective about my free
time.  I was probably a worse husband, father, son, and friend this year.  At
the same time, it's hard to say that I wasn't aware that this was the deal I
was making.  I wanted to push myself to do more, and to have more to show for
it.  I'm proud of what I was able to achieve in 2018, but there was a cost too.

<!--BREAK-->

# Process

I kept my objectives from last year unchanged.  One of the tenets of the system
is that objectives are meant to be ambiguous and hard to complete.  It may take
multiple successful key results to satisfy the objective.  I consider it a good
thing to keep plugging away at the same goal year after year.

I'll also reiterate that I consider a 70% achievement rate to be a passing
score.  I'd rather aim high and find out where fall short rather than feel like
anything was too easy.

# Objective: Be healthier and happier.

I wanted to spend 2018 focusing a little more on exercise and health. I also
wanted to make sure that I was allocating my spare personal time fairly with my
wife and daughter too.

<h2>
  Key result: Bike to work 200 times
</h2>
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 100 "Class" "bg-success")}}

Last year I didn't develop a regular running habit, but did start biking to
work.  I did a quick calculation that there were about 250 working days in the
year, so I aimed to have 200 bike commuting days in 2018 (missing less than 1
work day per week).  I was able to stick to this (it helps that commuting by
bike is cheaper, faster, and healthier than any alternative) and completed 207
commutes by bike this year.  This number may have been sandbagged a
bit&mdash;I'd still have gotten a passing score if I'd aimed for 250.

<h2>

My goal this year was to have at least one special family outing per month.  We
tend to do a lot of these organically but it was nice to remind myself that
spending the better part of a Saturday with my family was still in service of
my objective of being happier.  We did a bunch of activities around San
Francisco: hikes at [Ft. Funston][link-funston] and [Sweeney
Ridge][link-sweeney], visiting [Curiodyssey][link-curiodyssey], [the Academy of
Sciences][link-calacademy], [the SF Zoo][link-zoo], [the de
Young][link-deyoung], and [the Bay Area Discovery Museum][link-badm].  We went
to a ["Frozen" Sing-Along at the Castro Theater][link-singalong], and got a
cargo bike and biked as a family (dog too) around the city.   We haven't gotten
around to doing anything in December yet (and may not given how hectic this
month has been) but did at least one activity a month for the first 11 months
of this year.

<h2>
  Key result: Redesign dining room shelves
</h2>
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 50 "Class" "bg-warning")}}

This is a holdover from 2017, when I wanted to redo our dining area.  I made a
great deal of movement here without a ton of progress, precisely modeling our
home and dozens of candidate pieces of furniture in SketchUp.  But we didn't
quite pull the trigger on anything, as my wife and I became paralyzed by
choice.  I think we know what we want to do now, but actually getting the
changes made will go into 2019.

# Objective: Learn and grow intellectually.

I work with a lot of smart people, so I try not to feel dumb all the time.  I
still feel concerned that I don't subject myself to enough rigorous thinking
exercises, or more nuanced expressions of art.

<h2>
  Key result: Read 20 books
</h2>
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 95 "Class" "bg-success")}}
[blog-books]: {{link "048-reading-list-2018-books"}}

I [wrote about my 2018 reading list here][blog-books] and was able to complete
19 out of my target 20 books.  This is an increase of two books over 2017's
result, and I feel that I chose more challenging books this year.

<h2>
  Key result: Watch 8 cinema club films
</h2>
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 88 "Class" "bg-success")}}

[twitter-cinecium]: https://twitter.com/cinecium
[twitter-annihilation]: https://twitter.com/kurrik/status/973765542136836096
[blog-cinemaclub]: /tags/cinemaclub

My [cinema club][blog-cinemaclub] requirement used to include writing about
each film I watched.  This year I made a choice not to require myself to have
to write a blog post for each entry in the hopes that I'd just watch more
films.  Subsequently, I moved film discussion off of this blog and [onto
Twitter][twitter-cinecium]. It's sometimes difficult to draw a separating line
between what makes a cinema club film vs. not.  I used to use the criteria of
"art film", but I've certainly watched a few commercial or studio films this
year.  I'm sticking to a loose definition of film with some kind of clear
artistic merit that I go out of my way to see (so for example no Annihilation
on this list despite [my fascination with it][twitter-annihilation]&mdash;I
would have watched it if I weren't aiming for this goal).  I'm counting 7
movies toward this key result:

1. [The Mirror](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072443/)
2. [Black Narcissus](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039192/)
3. [Stagecoach](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031971/)
4. [Slacker](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102943/)
5. [The Seventh Seal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050976/)
6. [Solaris](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069293/)
7. [Sorcerer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076740/)

I'd recommend all of them, although the two Tarkovsky films __The Mirror__ and
__Solaris__ were standouts to me.  I found __The Seventh Seal__ really striking
too, and painted some scenes from the black &amp; white film in ink during
Inktober.  Overall, I think I got some great references to draw on in terms of
composition, editing, and scene construction for a creative project I want to
attempt next year.

<h2>
  Key result: Finish Referaat
</h2>

[blog-referaat]: {{link "044-caesar-cipher"}}
[link-procrastination]: https://99u.adobe.com/articles/7286/the-power-of-structured-procrastination

This is my perennial [structured procrastination][link-procrastination] "Very
Important Task" which I keep putting off.  I got a single [blog
post][blog-referaat] together which I estimate at maybe 5% of the total effort
needed to finish the entire paper and translate it to Estonian.  Oh well.

<h2>
  Key result: Regular Mandarin practice
</h2>
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 69 "Class" "bg-warning")}}

I didn't define "regular" very well, but did set a reminder to do a Rosetta
Stone Mandarin lesson every 4 days this year, which is roughly 90 exercises in
2018.  I completed 62, about one every 6 days.  I don't think I made as much
progress here as I liked (I don't feel remotely conversational in Mandarin) and
am looking to increase my effort here next year.

# Objective: Create things.

Many of the creative endeavors I took on in 2018 were intended to be practice
for a larger, more focused project in 2019.  I'll talk more about that later,
but I wanted to improve my ability to create art, write a story, and publish an
app in the App Store.

<h2>
  Key result: Digital art every two weeks (except theme months)
</h2>
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 82 "Class" "bg-success")}}

With the exception of theme months in October and November, I aimed to make a
piece of digital art every other week.  This could be a 3D render or a
painting on my iPad.  I completed 18 out of the target 22, and posted these to
[my Instagram account][link-instagram] throughout the year.

<h2>
  Key result: Inktober 5k

[link-inktober]: https://inktober.com/

I follow several artists on Twitter who take part in [Inktober][link-inktober]
each year.  During the month of October, participants complete one ink-based
artwork a day.  This seemed like a good challenge, but I didn't have the
bandwidth for a painting a day.  There's a "half marathon" which is a painting
every other day, and a "5k" option, which is one painting a week.  To get my
feet wet, I decided to try a 5k and completed four ink-based paintings in
October.  This was my first time painting in ink, and I found myself enjoying
the process.  Technically, it's the same approach as painting watercolor, but
since you don't have to worry about color I found it easier to focus on value
instead.  I generally picked subjects suitable for black ink, painting a couple
stills from __The Seventh Seal__ and a couple portraits of BMO, our dog.

The [National Novel Writing Month][link-nanowrimo] (or NaNoWriMo) takes place
in November and challenges participants to write a 50,000 word novel in 30
days.  I've had a couple friends do this and have been fascinated with the idea
of sprinting to get the structure of a book down in only one month.  I didn't
have the bandwidth to make an earnest attempt this year, but I did have the
outline of a story for a game I wanted to make. I decided to to spend 30
minutes each day in November fleshing it out into a screenplay, completing
11,332 words by the end of the month.  I'll be using this screenplay as the
basis for a game I want to work on in 2019.

I've been working on [a game for my daughter Ada][link-tinypatch] on and off
for about two years now.  In the interest of getting used to publishing an app
to the Apple and Google App Stores, I set a goal to finish this up in 2018.
While I made a lot of progress on the game itself and was able to get beta
testing versions out, I still don't have it finished enough to feel comfortable
making it generally available.  This is probably my most regretted miss of the
year, as I really wanted to close out this project to free up some mental
capacity for 2019.

<h2>
  Key result: Write 10 blog posts
</h2>
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 70 "Class" "bg-success")}}

I always feel like I should be writing more blog posts, but find it difficult
to spend the time to come up with a post I'm happy with.  I satisfied the
letter of my goal by publishing 7 out of 10 posts this year, but 3 of those
were self-reflective examinations of 2017 and 2018.  I did make one post in
service of making progress on my referaat, and another which explored some
ideas for a game I want to work on next year.  My published list for 2018 is:

1. [2017]({{link "043-2017"}})
2. [Caesar Cipher]({{link "044-caesar-cipher"}})
3. [Flow puzzles v1]({{link "045-flow-puzzles-v1"}})
4. [Which word has the most valid subwords?]({{link "046-subwords"}})

# Planning for 2019
I thought that I attempted too many things in 2018 and subsequently took on a
fair amount of stress and failed to accomplish some larger goals.  At work I
perpetually push my team to focus on fewer more impactful things and I'd like
to embrace that in my 2019 personal goals.  I'm in the surprising position of
being able to plan a bit in advance, so I've tried to think deliberately about
what I want to get done and what I'm willing to not do in order to succeed.

## Goals
In 2019, my OKRs are:

### Objective: Be healthier and happier.
**Key result: Days below target weight.** After losing quite a bit of weight
when my daughter was born in 2016, I've steadily gained it all back.  While
I've been able to keep good habits like biking to work, the net effect is still
negative and I've been feeling particularly unhealthy lately.  Instead of
focusing on specific activities, I'm going to plot a "target weight" for 2019
and plan to lose 1lb / week until I'm at that weight.  I'll score myself by
number of days I stay below that projection throughout the year, with a perfect
score being 365 and a perfect failure being 0.  I'm hoping by focusing on the
outcome rather than specific activities, I'll make adjustments throughout my
daily routine (exercise, diet, etc) as necessary.

**Key result: 12 planned family trips.** I reached my excursions goal for 2018
but felt like I could be more ambitious next year.  Ada will be at the age
where we can start doing more daddy/daughter activities together, and I'm
especially excited to plan her first ski trip next season.  I expect to flesh
these out in the next few weeks, but am currently planning:

1. January:  Bike over Golden Gate Bridge.
2. February: TBD.
3. March: Family trip to Hawaii (for a wedding).
4. April: TBD.
5. May: TBD.
6. June: Family trip to Seattle.
7. July: Boat ride in SF bay.
8. August: Family camping trip.
9. September: TBD.
10. October: TBD.
11. November: TBD.
12. December: Family ski trip.

###  Objective: Learn and grow intellectually.
**Key result: Practice Mandarin for 182 days.** I completed a Rosetta Stone
lesson every 6 days in 2018 and felt that I would do better with more regular
practice.  I'm going to shoot to complete some kind of structured lesson
(either Rosetta Stone or some other program) every other day in 2019.

###  Objective: Create things.
[link-puzzle]: {{link "045-flow-puzzles-v1"}}
**Key result: Playable Act 1 for adventure game.** I've spent the last couple
of years accumulating a set of skills to be able to work on an indie adventure
game.  Picking up painting, watching art films, writing a screenplay for
NaNoWriMo, posting about [test puzzle mechanics][link-puzzle] and working on a
mobile game for Ada were all in service of this. I think I've gotten to the
point where I'm ready to commit serious time toward developing my concept in
2019.  My goal is to have a playable vertical slice of the game by 2020,
encompassing Act 1 of the screenplay I worked on this year.  I believe this
will be enough to demonstrate whether this idea has merit and whether I should
invest real resources into hiring artists/musicians to help me try to finish
the game and get it published.  This is one of the most ambitious things I'll
have done in my life, and I'm incredibly eager to start on it in earnest next
year.

## Non-Goals
For everything I want to do next year, it's important to acknowledge that there
are multiple things which I will not be able to get done.

As much as I enjoyed learning to paint in the past two years, I also found
myself dreading having to come up with something each week and would block
other things when procrastinating on painting.  So while I may still break out
the gouache set for some plein air practice on vacation or concept art for my
game, I won't be goaling on a certain number of pieces next year.

I do find writing blog posts and working on the research for the referaat
rewarding, but these are also activities I dread as I get further behind them
during the year.  If I find something to blog about or feel inspired to
continue my paper I'll do them, but won't compel myself either.

I got very close to publishing Tiny Patch, but never finished it up.  I don't
want to drag it out for an indefinite amount of time and would prefer to spend
my game development energies on the adventure game project next year.  This
will likely be on hold until 2020.

NaNoWriMo / Inktober were rewarding distractions in 2018.  In the interest of
focus, I won't be doing them again in 2019 unless I can use them to structure
work for one of my key goals.

I will not set myself a target for books to read or cinema club films to watch
in 2019.  I expect my volume of consumption of both will drop next year.  This
is a particularly painful non-goal for me, but focus is king next year.

In happier non-goal news, I think biking to work has become a habit at this
point.  It's cheaper and faster than alternatives, plus a useful form of
exercise. I already feel regret on days when I don't bike to work, so I'm not
setting a target for next year.

# Wrapping up
Writing this post for the past few years has been a key form of
self-reflection.  I tend to debate myself on the intended audience for this
kind of thing and while it's ultimately more for me than anyone else, I do find
some value in this kind of public accounting. I sometimes share these posts
with others to shed some light on how I intend to live my life as I find it
important to be both deliberate and ambitious in this respect.  If I have any
virtue it is patience, and if I have any skill it is the ability to plan.  I'm
investing in a set of tools to rely on in the future and accomplishments to be
proud of when I'm older.  While next year is only one step along the way, it is
an important one.  I'm excited for it in a way which I haven't been for a
while.  To a wonderful 2019!
