[post-2018]: {{ link "049-2018" }}

2019 was a tough year for me, but it's hard for me to point a finger at any
single cause or even piece of evidence of this claim.  My wonderful family has
been a cornerstone of my life and this was my favorite year with our daughter
Ada so far (she turned 3 in 2019).  I've been successful at work and grew my
team to 35 people.  We had a few small setbacks this year but were still
surrounded by family and friends and were able to enjoy two wonderful family
trips to attend weddings in Hawaii and Seattle.

I think for me it felt like I got into too much of a routine and didn't really
break out of it enough.  The strongest driving force for me is to make things:
programs, games, artwork, films, food.  My next biggest driver is to experience
the creative works of others, particularly books and films which challenge my
viewpoint.  My third driver is to get out into the natural world and do
intensive backpacking and hiking.  I don't think I satisfied any of these three
impulses in 2019.

In 2020, I see the opportunity to celebrate and recognize all of the things
going well in my life, but to improve my understanding of what I find
fulfilling and spend more time making things and expanding my point of view.  I
believe that examining the past year and how I did against my expectations is a
key part of this iterative process, so I'd like to cover how I scored my goals
for the past year and how that feeds into my plans for the next.

# Objective: Be healthier and happier.
## Key result: Days below target weight.
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 49 "Class" "bg-warning")}}

My goal was to get into better shape in 2019, so I modeled a target weight
which decreated each day until reaching my goal for the year. Then I counted
how many days I could stay below target. In the first half of the year, I kept
on pace or better and even reached my annual goal for a single day in July.
Something switched at that point and I started steadily gaining pounds back. I
tried to reset my daily target in September when I had gotten really far away
from it, but that didn't work.  I really lost control of things in the period
from Thanksgiving through New Years as you can see from the graph below. A
minor setback I hope: I'm starting this year better off than I was at the start
of 2019 and I continue trying to figure out what works for me in 2020.

In June I was feeling overwhelmed at work and wanted to try and understand that
better.  I started scoring myself on a subjective 5 point scale on how happy I
was feeling at the end of each day: 1 being a really bad day, 3 fairly
unremarkable, and 5 fantastic.  I averaged each measure by week and plotted the
trendline below.  I think the line indicates what I've intuitively
suspected--that I was slowly getting more unhappy in 2019.  The graph includes
working days only and doesn't count in weekends (where I'm generally happier),
but I think the measure is still pretty interesting.  I'll be tracking this
every day in 2020.

## Key result: 12 planned family trips.
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 92 "Class" "bg-success")}}

On the topic of enjoyable weekends, I felt that my goal of planning more
activities with my family went well this year.  We had a mix of local San
Francisco activities and trips to other states. These activities included Ada's
first baseball game, camping trip, and ski lesson.  It's really exciting to
plan these "firsts" and even gives us the chance to build up family traditions.
I'm eager to do more next year.

It really did feel like I was able to focus on spending more time with Steph
and Ada this year, and even though 11 completed trips doesn't sound like a
great deal, I really enjoyed every one of them.  They all feature in my 2019
one second every day video, where you can get a clear sense of how much fun we
had as a family over the course of the year.

# Objective: Learn and grow intellectually.
## Key result: Practice Mandarin for 182 days.
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 95 "Class" "bg-success")}}

I practiced Mandarin using Rosetta Stone on 174 days in 2019.  To be honest,
it's not really giving me much in the way of discussion skills, but I have been
understanding snippets of conversations when overhearing conversations or if
Steph is watching a show or listening to a podcast in Mandarin.  I found that
Ada likes to listen to the program too, so some nights I run through a lesson
while giving Ada a bath.  Increasing the frequency of lessons to
roughly every other day seemed to help me with retention, so I'm expecting to
keep up this pace next year.

# Objective: Create things.
## Key result: Playable Act 1 for adventure game.
{{template "progress" (map "Value" 5 "Class" "bg-danger")}}

This was the goal I was [most excited to take on last year][post-2018] but
wound up being the hardest to make any kind of real progress against.  I
started off the year with various tech demos exploring shader effects,
rendering character animations, point and click navigation and felt that things
were off to a promising start.  However, the idea of working on such an
ambitious and personal project was so weighty that I don't think I ever felt
comfortable getting past all of this [yak
shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving).  I
hardly opened any project files or even planning documents in the second half
of the year.  As a goal, this was a fairly big failure.

I used my guilt about not working on the "big" game as a positive force for
structured procrastination, though.  I decided I wanted to learn some more 3D
modeling and took an [online Blender 3D
class](http://www.heavypoly.com/blender-online-class) which I really enjoyed.
I got much more comfortable using the Blender software, and created the
following works as part of my homework for the class.

{{template "gallery-lightbox"}}

Unable to make headway against a bigger game project, I did devote a weekend to
the 45th instance of [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/), completing [Zero
Coast](https://kurrik.itch.io/zero-coast) entirely by myself (the first time
I've finished solo!)

<div class="roomanna-centered">
  <figure class="roomanna-figure">
    {{template "image" (.Image "zerocoast")}}
  </figure>
</div>

I cracked open [Beatwave](https://beatwave.co/) on the iPad and created music
for Zero Coast in less than an hour.  This is the first time I've made a song
and I was proud to see people compliment the game's music, not knowing how far
out of my comfort zone creating it was.

So I didn't make the thing I set out at the start of the year to make, but I
did make some things which I felt proud of.

# Planning for 2020

I wish I had made more things in 2019.  I'd lost sight of the joy of sharing
things and the satisfaction of actually creating something for others to
experience.  I still feel that I want to make my adventure game, but getting
lost in the big picture really held me back.   In 2020 I want to work on things
which I find creatively stimulating.  I want to recognize the effort to make
things, regardless of whether a project winds up being a big ambitious
narrative, a weekend art project, a simple piece of music, or a watercolor
painting.  So I'm removing any sort of criteria for what I want to make, but
will hold myself to **make two things a month**, where anything I make on my
own is valid as long as I share it with others in some way.

As I didn't make my target weight goal in 2019, I will once again **plan to
stay below a target weight line** in 2020.  To help with that, I'm also
committing to **200 days of exercise** in any 20+ minute form, be it commuting
to work on my road bike, going for a run in the park, or an actual session at
the gym.

I'm still expecting to take at least **one family trip or outing per month**
and we already have more ski and camping trips planned.  I'm also planning **a
trip to Alaska** with the goal of backpacking for a longer period and taking a
kayak trip to see a glacier (while I still can).

As I think about my own learning and exposure to culture, I regret purposefully
drawing down the number of books I read in 2019.  As I have a considerable
backlog of books and films I'd like to get through, I'm committing to **read 17
books and watch 15 films** off of my list. These selections are going to seem
pretty random, and I have various reasons for picking each.  A common theme is
that I either have a copy of these or have been intending to read/watch them
for over a year, so in a way I see 2020 as an opportunity to clear myself of
some long-held baggage.

Dwight Eisenhower said "plans are useless, but planning is indispensable".  I
enter 2020 with more clarity about the life I want to live, a scaffold for how
to go about it, and an excitement to see what kinds of unexpected opportunities
will arise throughout the year.  Here's to a better 2020.
