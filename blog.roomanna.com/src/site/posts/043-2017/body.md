I tried something new in 2017, which was to make a set of personal OKRs and
attempt to fulfill them throughout the year.  OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
are typically used as a planning framework by companies (both Google and
Twitter implement them) but I had never tried to structure personal goals in
this way.   I'm not sure it's a general approach which would work for anyone
else, but I liked the idea of taking a set of higher-level, abstract goals and
trying to track quantitative progress against them.

I respect the compounding effects of small adjustments to my personal habits,
and tend to use New Year resolutions to implement such changes. In 2014 I
started making one-second-per-day videos (and have done so in [2014][2014],
[2015][2015], and [2016][2016] so far!).  In 2015 I started regular Rosetta
Stone lessons to learn Mandarin (which was less successful but I know a few key
phrases at least).  In 2016 I tracked my weight and food every day with the
intent of losing 30 lbs by the time my daughter was born (successful, but I
didn't keep it off).  In 2017 I wanted to be healthier and happier, learn and
grow intellectually, and create things.  Here is my accounting of how that
went.

<!--BREAK-->

I generally understand OKRs as a mapping from higher-level and typically
qualitative goals to a set of key results which should have the accumulated
impact of helping satisfy these goals.  The key results are supposed to be
quantitative, and it's important to regularly measure and track progress
against them.  So I found a set of things I thought I could do (and track)
which would contribute to my health, growth, and creativity.  An important note
is that OKRs are meant to be aspirational - getting 100% is typically a sign
that you set the target too low.  So as a rule of thumb, 70% or higher is
considered a passing score. (And yes, people sandbag these numbers all the
time.)
