... have met and in many cases exceeded the expectations I had when thinking
about joining the company.  Obviously I'm still in the honeymoon period and
things are still moving fast, but the energy and culture of the place have been
inspiring.  I've found a few things particularly worth gushing over:

<!--BREAK-->

# Management

I think a lot of a company's spirit comes directly from the top.  At Google, I
always respected Larry, Sergey, and Eric for being open and direct, while still
fostering an atmosphere of playfulness and respect throughout the company.  Yet
Google is a company which has clear and direct objectives and achieves an
astounding rate of progress when it decides to move in a direction.  One of my
concerns before showing up at Twitter was how the executive staff was going to
measure up. I shouldn't have been worried.  The atmosphere is playful, a touch
irreverent, and there's a strong guiding voice for the style and the direction
of the company.  Dick Costolo's [improv experience][2] has been on display
every time I've seen him speak: he's spontaneous, funny, and inspiring. I
haven't had the fortune to see Jack yet, but his talks are already gaining a
[legendary reputation][3] in the valley.  It's been a short time, but I really
feel confident in the leadership at Twitter.

# My team

The Developer Relations team is so much smaller than the team I was on at
Google (even if you only count Chrome DevRel) that it's amazing to see how much
has been done up until this point.  The stuff on [dev.twitter.com][19] is done
by such a small team, yet the quality of the docs and discussion support are
top notch.  Most of the features on the site are implemented in-team, and
they've already got features which Google Groups and code.google.com were quite
slow to implement.  Twitter's API has a reputation for simplicity, but after
seeing how the sausage has been made for a couple weeks, I think this
reputation has as much to do with the great support work this team has done, as
with an elegant API design.

# The environment

I didn't think this would be as big of a deal, but I love working in San
Francisco.  Even though I have to fight through Muni in the morning, there's
something energizing about being in the middle of this city every day.  SF's
style bleeds into the workplace as well, from all the [goofy internet memes
decorating the walls][4], to the rows of bikes in the lobby (not all fixies!),
to the festive social culture (three team dinners/happy hours in my first two
weeks).  Google had its own culture (which I loved) but this feels just a bit
more raw, like a scrappy startup should.  Any company which makes a recruiting
video in the style of [one of my favorite movies ever][5] is hitting all the
right notes, in my opinion:

## The potential

[Leaving Google][1] was obviously a choice I couldn't make lightly. During that
time I heard a lot of folks questioning Twitter's ability to monetize, or be a
'real' product.  I appreciate that they didn't want me to make a decision which
they saw as unwise, but ultimately these discussions led to a lot of thought
and the eventual realization that I truly believe in Twitter's strong future as
a profitable and useful communications tool.  As an early-ish joiner (member
number [7,588,892][6]) I've watched Twitter grow from a simple way to ping
friends and update a status line on my blog, to a channel which provides some
of my most engaging conversations and informational leads throughout a given
day.  It's a testament to how widespread the brand is that when I told my
parents about my decision to leave Google, both had already heard about Twitter
through other channels. I guess that a tool simple and flexible enough for
[fresh bread][10], [political scandals][11], [NATO / Taliban spats][12], [theme
songs for beauty pagents][13] and [the POTUS himself][14] has earned that
reputation.  And being part of being able to build out that product, especially
during a time where product features such as [photos][8] [referral tracking][9]
and [analytics][16] are happening, while the leaders are having significant
discussions around [monetization][15] is an exciting time - a time when big,
impressive things get done.

I'm looking forward to contributing as much as I can.
