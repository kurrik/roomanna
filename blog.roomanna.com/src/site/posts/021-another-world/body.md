I saw [this][1] today.

At some point, I'll walk into some sort of Exploratorium with my child, and
amongst the exhibits will be an opportunity to control a Mars rover over the
internet for a few minutes, and the child will not appreciate how
exhilaratingly wild and astounding that will be.

When rendered in a high definition 360 degree view, the sheer mundanity of
what we see (these rocks are like _our_ rocks) implies a terrifying vastness
of shared experience across the solar system.  We may find unimaginable
sights in deep space, but there are also anchor points.

This mission, which has been fed by every cultural achievement humans have
made, seems to be on a laser-straight path toward a golden,
existence-redefining moment.  That we will find evidence of life on Mars
seems like a
certainty to me.  We'll probably eventually be surprised by the sheer volume
of what we find, given better tools to help detect it.
