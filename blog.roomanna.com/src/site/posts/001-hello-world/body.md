So upon getting here you may be wondering general questions like "what is
this", and "why are they making me read this page" and "why is there suffering
in this modern world, what with computers and all"?  All excellent questions to
be sure, and I figured I'd devote some space to answering them before getting
to the process of writing down whatever comes to mind while completing my
day-to-day tasks at my nerd job.

Oops, I've gone and given it away, haven't I?  Well, this is a site I'm using
to keep track of various ideas that I'm working on at any given time, plus
anything else that I feel needs expounding on.  Don't worry, I'll keep the
personal opinion stuff pretty mild.  I'm really just tired of filling in a
blank on all those "Personal blog" forms I'm constantly filling out.

As a bit of requisite backstory, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area from New
Jersey in 2007 to take a job with a nascent advertising megacorporation startup
named [Google][link-google], doing all kinds of developer outreach sort of
stuff. Here I am in all my na√Øve glory (on the left):

<div class="roomanna-centered">
  <figure class="roomanna-figure">
    {{template "image" (.Image "arne")}}
  </figure>
</div>

The construction of the blog itself is a bit more interesting, to be honest. I
decided to use [Jekyll][link-jekyll], mostly for reasons explained well
[here][link-why].  What Ted doesn't mention, though, is how Jekyll won't let
you do things like create per-tag or per-category pages, show post snippets, or
any of the stuff that must be too esoteric to support.  Thankfully, [better
people than me][link-j++] have fixed such issues, and I'm happy using
_jekyll\_ext_ to construct this thing.  If you're really curious about how the
sausage is made, then feel free to check out the [source on
github][link-github].

And in all honesty the markup and stuff here is pretty pathetic for someone who
is supposed to know something at all about HTML, so I'll be playing around with
stuff as I go along.  You can't be a blogger without writing, though, and I was
really tired of fucking around with the design of this thing while posts were
going unwritten.

So I'm posting this, and I'll be posting more until I get bored.  Hope you like
stuff that's awesome!

Also, I should note that yes, I am currently an employee of Google, although
