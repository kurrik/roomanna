After an [amazing Google I/O session][link-1] last week, I'm doing a bit of
touring around on the East Coast until June.  There's a ton of [GTUGs][link-5]
within driving distance of NJ, so I'm hitting up a few.

<!--BREAK-->

I'll be giving a modified version of my I/O talk at each event.  There's still
a few demos Eric and I have tucked away, so there'll be some new content if
you've already seen the I/O session.  I'll also do Q/A about anything I'm
capable of answering if you had any questions.

I usually don't do US events outside of Silicon Valley, so it's great to be
able to do this many events in such a short span.  The GTUG organizers have
been really helpful in getting this all set up!
