I’m at Moscone Center in San Francisco this week, as a speaker in this year’s 
Google I/O conference.  [My session][link-1] is tomorrow (May 11th) and as a 
first, I’ll be livestreamed over the internet.  If you’re interested in 
viewing the session, you should be able to 
[see it here, starting at 10:45am PDT][link-2].   We’re bringing a lot of 
great content, and will try to bring the funny as well.

[Eric Bidelman][link-3] and I will be talking about some of the newer HTML 
features that have been implemented in Chrome during the past year.  We’re 
doing a pretty demo-heavy talk, so we’re going to show you the “wow”, 
then break down the “how” of building everything.  Everything will be open 
sourced and I’ll be following up on my blog about demo specifics once 
we’re done.

One limitation of the conference format is that we’re limited to 60 minutes 
including QA.  Early in the planning of our session, Eric and I decided 
that we wouldn’t cover a lot of the basic features of HTML5.  There’s 
already a [bunch of great content][link-6] covering this stuff, and I’d 
suggest viewing [my session from last year][link-7] if you want a primer.  

Favorite announcement of the conference this far?  I’m looking forward to 
using [Music Beta][link-4], but hands down it has to be 
[Go on App Engine][link-5].  First compiled language to run on App Engine?  
That’s some crazy sauce right there.
