[Racing the Beam][1] is kind of like a biography for the Atari systems and
 their unique underlying circuit design.  Actually, it's kind of like one of
 those band documentaries where the band is already established so you just
 follow them around and see their interactions with common folk.  Eventually
 there's some scene where a band member blows up or throws a tantrum and
 probably didn't mean anything at the time but foreshadows the
 band's eventual downfall/breakup and so forth.

<!--BREAK-->

In Racing the Beam you don't see how the Atari was designed. Instead,
the book seems to expect a little bit of knowledge about the system design (even
from a wires and chips point of view).  Instead of holding your hand with regard
to the technology involved,
the focus is on tricks used to write games, the personalities
behind those games, and then the kinds of problems which wound up
killing the whole platform off.

I found it interesting that the abundance
of low quality software on the platform is generally attributed to killing
the Atari. I've been party to a lot of discussions involving curation of
app stores during my career and I think that this is the first example
I've seen where lack of curation was attributed toward the death of
an entire ecosystem.

The book establishes an abstract argument about how the expression of
hacking around the limitations of the system was really a form of art
in itself.  Honestly, I don't know what my feelings are about videogames
and art, or electrical design and art, but solely from the basis of the
argument in the book, I wasn't terribly convinced.  It was weird to cover
the internals of the system in depth and then jump into a more philosophical
point of view about art and artistry.

There were two enlightening concepts I did wind up learning from this book:
first, that one person had majority control over any given Atari game, from
programming to art to sound and controls.  In fact, compared to the sequel
/ reimagining atmosphere common in movies and games nowadays, the book
actually covers sections where authors were given free<D-r> reign to try
out original ideas:

<blockquote><p>This type of inspiration and divergence, caused by
developersâ€™ casual encounters with research or amateur work and their
interest in reimplementing or improving it, was common at the
time.</p></blockquote>

Yet programmers were still seemingly deemed commodities even though
they added so much personality to each product.  This wound up leading
to easter eggs embedded in many games.   It also seemed like programming
and porting games was much more of a cowboy culture.  For example, from
the book:

<blockquote><p>Brad Stewart, who had earlier done the port of Breakout
to the Atari VCS after winning the right to port the game by besting a
fellow programmer in the arcade Breakout</p></blockquote>

So the right to do a port of a popular game was settled in the arcade
itself.  Pretty badass.

The second concept was how much the hardware designed the visual look of
the platform, which I think I attributed to aesthetic choice when I was a
child, but was a result of limited hardware and resources.  For example, a
scan line could only change colors dynamically every 3 "pixels" across its
sweep, leading to very "wide" looking characters and non-sprite graphics.
Some of the most pleasing effects were from hardware hacks which the book
describes in detail, for example how transparencies were achieved for
the Pac-Man port:

<blockquote><p>The TIA synchronizes with an NTSC television picture sixty
times per second, so the resulting display shows a solid Pac-Man, maze,
and pellets, but ghosts that flicker on and off, remaining lit only one
quarter of the time.</p></blockquote>

I consider myself non-ironically into Atari, game programming tricks, and
early computer design, so this book was a no-brainer for me.  I think
that if you were less into the circuit design, or less into the
specifics of individual 2600 games, you would have much less to
appreciate.  If you just like playing Adventure but don't want to
know why and how it was written, then this book may not be for you.  If you
didn't get the reference to Adventure, then it's almost certainly not.
