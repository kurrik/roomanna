With my [decision to leave Google to work for Twitter][2], I am now officially
unemployed for the first time in four years, and will be for slightly over one
week.  I have named this week **Freedom Week**.

!['Like Shark Week but for Freedom'][1]

Like [Shark Week][6], **Freedom Week** will be free as in beer (as in I will be
drinking some).  Unlike Shark Week, **Freedom Week** will be free as in
freedom, meaning that for once in my life, I have full control over copyright
and licensing for any code I manage to create.  Naturally, I'm reminded of
[the best description of a summer break, ever][5]:

> It's the beginning of the summer and I'm standing in the lobby of a
> thousand-story grand hotel, where a bank of elevators a mile long and
> an endless row of monkey attendants in gold braid wait to carry me up,
> up, up through the suites of moguls, of spies, and of starlets, to rush
> me straight to the zeppelin mooring at the art deco summit, where they
> keep the huge dirigible of August tied up and bobbing in the high
> winds. On my way to the shining needle at the top I will wear a lot
> of neckties, I will buy five or six works of genius on 45 rpm, and
> perhaps too many times I will find myself looking at the snapped
> spine of a lemon wedge at the bottom of a drink. I said, "I anticipate
> a coming season of dilated time and of women all in disarray."

It would be a shame to squander
such an opportunity, so I've come up with some principles to adhere to:

<!-- -**-END-**- -->

1. **Have fun**

   For once I actually have nothing on my plate, so I should pick things
   which interest me and look like they'd be fun to do.  [Watching Notch
   program][3] an [entire game][4] in 48 hours last week was amazing not
   only because he got so much done, but because he seemed to be having
   so much fun doing it.  Ultimately he spent more time adding features
   rather than infrastructure, which, while bad for a long term project,
   seems like the most effective use of time for writing code in a short
   time span.

2. **Write something useful**

   Given #1, I also want to write something that could be useful to others.
   I intend to [open source][7] everything under Apache 2, and I will try to
   write at least one client library for Twitter, which brings me to...

3. **Learn something new**

   I shouldn't be afraid to spend time learning things which will help me
   in the future.  I don't know enough of the Twitter APIs, so writing a client
   library will help me explore them.  I'm also considering writing a better
   blog backend, since posting right now has too much overhead.

   Additionally, I've got a few books lying around that I've been meaning
   to poke around in.  The most *fun* looks to be [Real-Time Rendering][8]
   since I've just started playing around with WebGL and want to learn
   how to do things like shadows or crazy glowy effects.

4. **Don't get bored**

   I only have one week, yet tons of ideas and dream projects. So one thing
   I don't have the luxury of doing is getting bored and deciding to play
   Mass Effect or watch movies on Netflix instead.  I need to be able to
   dump a project which is becoming a bore in favor of something which satisfies
   principle #1 better.

I don't really know what I'll be doing first, but if you're interested in
following along, I'll be posting to [GitHub][7] and [Twitter][9] as I go.
