Before we begin, a little bit about me...
=========================================
So upon getting here you may be wondering general questions like "what is 
this", and "why are they making me read this page" and "why there suffering in 
this modern world"?  All excellent questions to be sure, and I figured I'd 
devote some space to answering them before getting to the process of logging
my bike rides around the San Francisco Bay Area.

Oops, I've gone and given it away, haven't I?  Well, this is a site I'm using
to keep track of where I've been biking, as well as offer a bit of commentary
for those folks who don't have the luxury of biking in and around SF.  As a
bit of requisite backstory, I moved here from New Jersey in 2007 to take a job
with a nascent advertising megacorporation startup named Google and was pretty
quickly drafted into service on a Google-themed bike team by some of my 
workmates.  They got me innocently enough - "fun" rides over the Golden Gate
Bridge, short afternoon jaunts for some sightseeing, and then slightly more
intense rides to work in the morning (back when I lived about 10 miles from
Mountain View).  Here I am in all my naive glory (on the left):

Anyway, turns out that riding over the bridge and short spans to work are just
"gateway" rides which lead into all sorts of unsavory behavior such as 
purchasing expensive road bikes, "breathable" and "padded" riding gear, 
reading [elitist bike blogs](http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/) and the ultimate
sign that things are not going to be getting better any time soon - signing up
for charity rides.

The ride in question is called [Waves to Wine](http://bikecan.nationalmssociety.org/site/PageServer?pagename=BIKE_CAN_homepage)
as it describes a route from San Francisco (people **waving** at the start) up
to Napa Valley wine country (where people **whine** about having biked too far)
which runs anywhere from 125 to 175 miles, depending on the route you take.

At this point in the story, I've actually gone on two of these rides, raised
a bit of money to help fight MS, and generally had a good time of things (bike
sores and weird arm tans notwithstanding).  This year I've decided to go "big"
though, get in a lot of training, and try and hit the $2500 mark required to 
be a "top" fundraiser.  Since my stance on such things is that anyone who 
donates to my cause should get *something* for their contribution, I've decided
to do the equivalent of giving mom a handwritten card for her birthday and 
**make** something for you all.  Isn't that special!

So coming up you should expect all the awful details of my training rides this
year.  I've even obtained some advanced tools of a technological nature, which 
should make this all an engaging multimedia experience.

And if I can convince you to donate even a little bit to this year's ride, you
can do that [at my MS Society homepage](http://main.nationalmssociety.org/goto/kurrik)
- jokes aside, I'd be quite grateful.

As for the suffering question, the obvious answer to that is *there is suffering
because humankind invented the bicycle*.
